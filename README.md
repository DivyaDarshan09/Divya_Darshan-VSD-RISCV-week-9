## VSD Baby SoC – Physical Design (RTL to GDSII)
- This repository documents the complete ASIC Physical Design (PD) flow carried out for the VSD RISC-V Baby SoC, using the open-source SKY130 PDK and industry-standard open-source EDA tools.
- The objective of this project is to take a synthesizable RISC-V SoC design through every stage from RTL to final GDSII, similar to a real production-grade chip tape-out flow.

## 🙌 Personal Note

- I began this journey with prior knowledge in digital and hardware design, and through this project, I was able to strengthen my understanding even more. By working hands-on through each stage — from RTL to GDSII — I gained deeper practical experience, clearer insights, and greater confidence in implementing a real RISC-V SoC flow.

- All the work, analysis, debugging, and documentation in this repository have been completed independently by **Divya Darshan VR**. I am proud of the progress I have made, and I know there is still much more to learn — and I am excited for the journey ahead.

- All the work, experiments, analysis, documentation, and results in this repository have been completed by **Divya Darshan VR** with full dedication and continuous learning throughout the RISC-V SoC tapeout journey.  

- I am truly happy and proud to have come this far and to be a part of this wonderful learning experience. I hope that my effort, consistency, and passion help me earn a place among the **Top 50 selected students**.

- 1 more week to go !!!!!!

- Thank you for reviewing my work!

- Thank You Kunal Sir and VSD Team for this wonderful oppurtunity.
