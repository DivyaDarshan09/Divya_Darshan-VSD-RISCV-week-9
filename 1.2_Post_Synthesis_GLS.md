# Post-Synthesis Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) - VSDBabySoC
---
##  Objective
This part focuses on performing **Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** for the **VSDBabySoC** design using the synthesized netlist.  
The goal is to **verify** that the GLS results match the **functional simulation outputs** obtained in Week 2.

---

##  What is Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)?
**Gate-Level Simulation (GLS)** is a verification step where the **synthesized netlist** (composed of logic gates and flip-flops) is simulated to verify that it behaves **identically** to the RTL-level functional simulation.

GLS helps ensure:
- Correctness of synthesis output.
- Detection of timing or logic issues introduced during synthesis.
- Validation of reset logic, clock propagation, and signal integrity.

---

##  Why Do We Need GLS?
1. **Verification of Logic Equivalence:**  
   Ensures that the design post-synthesis behaves the same as the RTL design.

2. **Timing Verification:**  
   Helps catch timing-related glitches or X-propagation issues that may not appear in RTL simulation.

3. **Confidence for Tapeout:**  
   Ensures the synthesized netlist is functionally correct before proceeding to layout or STA stages.

##  How to Perform Gate-Level Simulation
The GLS process involves these main steps:

### Step 1: Load the Top-Level Design and Supporting Modules

- Inside the Yosys shell, run:

```bash
read_verilog ./src/module/vsdbabysoc.v
read_verilog -I ./src/include ./output/compiled_tlv/rvmyth.v
read_verilog -I ./src/include ./src/module/clk_gate.v
```

### Step 2: Load the Liberty Files for Synthesis

-Inside the same Yosys shell, run:

```bash
read_liberty -lib src/lib/avsdpll.lib
read_liberty -lib src/lib/avsddac.lib
read_liberty -lib src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

### Step 3: Run Synthesis Targeting vsdbabysoc

```bash 
synth -top vsdbabysoc
```

![synthesize_design_3](.Screenshots/synthesize_design3.png)
![synthesize_design_4](.Screenshots/synthesize_design4.png)

---

### Step 4: Map D Flip-Flops to Standard Cells

```bash
dfflibmap -liberty /home/ananya123/VSDBabySoCC/VSDBabySoC/src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib
```

### Step 5: Perform Optimization and Technology Mapping

```bash
opt
abc -liberty ./src/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib 
```

![abc_technology_2](.Screenshots/abc_2.png)

---
### Step 6: Perform Final Clean-Up and Renaming

```bash
flatten
setundef -zero
clean -purge
rename -enumerate
```

### Step 7: Check Statistics

```bash
stat
```

![Check_stat_2](.Screenshots/check_stat_2.png)

---

### Step 8: Write the Synthesized Netlist

```bash
write_verilog -noattr ./output/post_synth_sim/vsdbabysoc.synth.v
```

## Post_Synthesis Simulation

### Step 1: Compile the Testbench
Run the following iverilog command to compile the testbench:

```bash
iverilog -o /home/ananya123/VSDBabySoCC/VSDBabySoC/output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.out -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM -DFUNCTIONAL -DUNIT_DELAY=#1 \ -I ./src/include \ -I ./src/module \ -I ./src/gls_model \  .src/module/testbench.v \ .output/post_synth_sim/vsdbabysoc.synth.v
```
---
### Step 2: Navigate to the Post-Synthesis Simulation Output Directory

```bash
cd output/post_synth_sim/
```
---
### Step 3: Run the Simulation

```bash 
./post_synth_sim.out
```
---
### Step 4: View the Waveforms in GTKWave

```bash
gtkwave post_synth_sim.vcd
```

## Final Observation

- The Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) results were found to be functionally equivalent to the RTL simulation results obtained in Week 2.
- This confirms that synthesis did not introduce any unintended logic changes.

**Conclusion:**  GLS output = Functional Simulation output

---

**Gate-Level Simulation (GLS) after synthesis confirmed that the netlist functionally matches the RTL, with successful waveform verification and no logic mismatches. This ensures that the synthesized circuitry is functionally correct and ready for timing validation in the physical design flow.**
